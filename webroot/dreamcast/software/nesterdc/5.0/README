----------------------------------------
** NOTE **
 VMU blocks use 

  most case: 
   - normal saving(nes): 3-9 blocks 
   - normal saving(fds): 3 blocks 
   - state saving(nes):  6-20 blocks 
   - state saving(fds):  66 blocks 

  worst case: (calculated by assuming compression had no effect)
   - normal saving(nes): 18 blocks (40 blocks if MMC5)
   - normal saving(fds): 520 blocks
   - state saving(nes):  96 blocks (240 blocks if MMC5)
   - state saving(fds):  700 blocks

----------------------------------------
** NOTE **
 VMU LCD info

    1st track (audio)
     audio.raw (or your favorite caution.wav)

    2nd track (data)
     /1ST_READ.BIN
     /pics/credits.bmp
     /pics/menu.bmp
     /pics/...
     /games/game.nes
     /games/disksys.rom
     /games/super_mario.nes
     /games/favorite/castlevania1.nes
     /games/favorite/castlevania2.nes
     /games/favorite/castlevania3.nes
     /games/fds/metroid.fds
     /games/fds/zelda.fds
     /games/...


--------------------
** NOTE ** 
  - If you play FDS games, need /games/disksys.rom.
  - If you use Rock Ridge format, there is no limit for filename. 
  - Max ROM files is 1024 per one directory. 


========================================
How to compile

1. edit nesterdc-5.0/dcmake
2. dcmake in top dir


--------------------
** NOTE **

My develop environment

 * NesterDC developing 
  - binutils-2.11.2
  - gcc-3.0.3
  - FreeBSD 4-stable

 * buring CD
  - NetBSD current
  - mkisofs + cdrecord

--------------------
** CAUTION **

I have no Windows PC, and I don't know HOWTO write CDs 
using Windows specific tools (DiskJuggler, Nero, ...).
