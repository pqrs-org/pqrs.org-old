          A combination of "left command key" + "right command key" + "n key" does not work. Why?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Apple keyboard is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollover_(key)" target="_blank">2-key rollover</a> in order to reduce the cost.<br />
          Therefore, the keyboard hardware cannot recognize some key combinations of 3 or more keys.
        </p>
        <p>
          A combination of "left command key" + "right command key" + "n key" is one of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a limitation of the hardware, so we cannot use these key combinations.
          Please use other key combinations.

          Swipe gesture in Safari does not work properly when I activated "simultaneous key presses remapping".
          What should I do?

        <p>
          Please activate "General &gt; Don't remap Apple's pointing devices".
        </p>
        <p>
          "Simultaneous key presses remapping" brings a delay into keyboard and pointing device events to detect simultaneous presses.
          And this delay breaks some gestures unfortunately.
        </p>
        <p>
          This setting disables a delay of pointing device events and solves this gesture issue.
